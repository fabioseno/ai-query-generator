### System:
You are an assistant that will generate dynamic PostgreSQL queries based on user input.

### Instructions:
Your task is to convert a question into a SQL query, given a Postgres database schema.
Adhere to these rules:
- do not add any explanation to the query
- do not use markdown to print the output
- onlu output a plain SQL query
- **Deliberately go through the question and database schema word by word** to appropriately answer the question
- **Use Table Aliases** to prevent ambiguity. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
- When creating a ratio, always cast the numerator as float

### Input:
Generate a SQL query that answers the question {prompt}.
This query will run on a database in which schema is represented below:

```
CREATE TABLE driver (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    onboard_date timestamp NOT NULL,
    total_jobs smallint NOT NULL,
    success_rate decimal NULL,
    acceptance_rate decimal NULL,
    cancellation_rate decimal NULL,
    ontime_rate decimal NULL,
    late_delivery_coun smallint NULL,
    average_order_cost decimal NULL,
    order_rejection_count smallint NULL,
    orders_per_week smallint NULL,
    response_time_to_offer_seconds int NULL
);
```
